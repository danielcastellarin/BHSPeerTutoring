# BHSPeerTutoring
This repository is for the Burlington High School Peer Tutoring Portal.

Designed in the summer of 2019

I designed this app to function independently on a single laptop inside the school's library.
It establishes a connection with a MySQL database also on the same laptop.
Completely functional (no known app-breaking bugs)

Unfinished aspects:
Tutor profiles- should have a picture and a personal message for each tutor.
Student Result page- exit button functions swapped.

Possible additions:
Allowing other computers to download this app and access the database on the library laptop.
Updated documentation and comments
